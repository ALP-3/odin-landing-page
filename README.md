CSS landing Page Project

This project is will be the culmination of everything I've learned from the HTML and CSS portions of TOP's foundations course. The goal is to recreate a landing page from an image and some external files to the best of my ability. THis will hopefully demostrate capabilities of understanding and using basic HTM and CSS syntax for designing web pages.
