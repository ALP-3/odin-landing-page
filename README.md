CSS landing Page Project

This project is will be the culmination of everything I've learned from the HTML and CSS portions of TOP's foundations course. The goal is to recreate a landing page from an image and some external files to the best of my ability. This will hopefully demostrate capabilities of understanding and using basic HTM and CSS syntax for designing web pages.

I've "completed" this project. There are a couple elements (haha-get it?) im still fuzzy on but the experience was great. I think ill do a couple more different projects before i move on to javascript portion of foundations just so I can cement all the techniques and experiences Ive picked up.

I will either come back to this project after learning more techniques and tricks or I will build new ones for more experience.
